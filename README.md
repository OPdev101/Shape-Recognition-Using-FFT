# Shape-Recognition-Using-FFT
The Shape Identification System is a MATLAB-based repository that provides a framework for accurately identifying and classifying shapes in digital images. The system employs a pattern recognition algorithm that combines contour analysis, signal processing, and frequency spectrum analysis to achieve robust shape recognition capabilities.

Key Features:

1: Shape Recognition: The system can identify various shapes, including rectangles, triangles, circles, polygons, and more, based on their unique contour features and frequency spectra.

2: Robustness to Variations: The algorithm is designed to handle variations in shape orientation, size/scale, and reference coordinate system location. It can accurately recognize shapes regardless of their rotational orientation and can handle different sizes/scales of the same shape.

3: Compatibility: The repository provides MATLAB code that is compatible with different versions of MATLAB, allowing users to seamlessly integrate the shape identification system into their projects.

4: Code Reusability: The codebase is modular and well-structured, facilitating easy customization and extension. Users can modify the code to incorporate additional shape recognition criteria or integrate it into larger image processing pipelines.

5: Comprehensive Documentation: The repository includes detailed documentation, explaining the underlying algorithm, code structure, and usage instructions. Users can quickly understand and utilize the system for their shape identification tasks.

6: Visualization and Plotting: The system generates visual outputs, such as contour plots, frequency spectra, and labeled shape identification results, aiding in the analysis and understanding of the shape recognition process.

The Shape Identification System repository provides a powerful tool for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in shape recognition, computer vision, and pattern recognition. By leveraging the implemented algorithm and code, users can efficiently identify and classify shapes in a wide range of applications, including object recognition, image analysis, and industrial automation.
